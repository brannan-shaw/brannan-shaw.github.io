          <div class="prompt">What is Neuroplasticity?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience. For a long time, it was believed that the brain stopped developing after a certain age. We now know this isn't true. The brain remains flexible, constantly remapping based on what we do, think, and learn</p>
            <p>It is a bit like when you walk on a nature trail. The more a certain path is taken, the more defined it becomes. Our brains work the same way. The more you practice a skill or challenge yourself with new things, the wider and more efficient those pathways in your brain will become.</p>

          <div class="prompt">What is a Growth Mindset?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>A growth mindset is the belief and approach that intelligence and abilities can be developed through effort, learning, and persistence.<br>In contrast, a fixed mindset is where people believe that their traits and attributes are static and unchangeable.</p>
            <p>Some thoughts driven by a growth mindset might be; "I cannot do this <em>yet</em>, but I will if I keep practicing." or "This failure is a learning opportunity."</p>

        <div class="point">
          <div class="prompt">Influence on learning</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>When you combine these two concepts, your ability to learn and improve yourself will evolve.<br>
              <ul>  
                <li>Challenges will start to look opportunities instead of obstacles.</li>
                <li>You will become more resilient wheen facing failure.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>A personal example of this is my thoughts towards loops in Javascript. I was overwhelmed when I first learned them and tried to apply them. I started to think that if I was struggling with this, what else am I going to struggle with? I had to stop myself.<br>
            I applied that growth mindset, acknowledging that, while it may be difficult now, I will be able to master them if I persist.</p>
