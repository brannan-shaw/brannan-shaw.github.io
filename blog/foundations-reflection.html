            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the Human Skills learning?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              I have learnt to take a step back at times and consider an
              approach from another direction. My ego would sometimes convince
              me that I must be doing the right thing from the start.<br />
              I have also realised that people are not going to judge when you
              do not know something. In the past I have sometimes been
              apprehensive to ask for help in a public forum for fear of
              judgement, but realising that my classmates are pretty much in the
              same boat as me and that we are all here to learn has made a
              massive difference.<br />
              Thirdly, to truly learn something, I am going to have to repeat it
              a lot. I am not going to remember every tidbit from the get go.

            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              They help us apply ourselves effectively. We are not able to learn
              without working hard and dedicating ourselves to it. We need to
              respect the content that we are learning and the time and energy
              put in by those to help us learn.<br />
              Empathy gives us a better platform to program from. If we approach
              a task with the mmindset that other people are going to have to
              understand it aswell, we can factor that in to how we want our
              final product to appear / work.<br />
              Self-awareness keeps us accountable. It allows us to incorporate
              our values and empathy into our actions and ensure the best
              outcome through those.

              Honestly, how much it has actually worked. Quite often, I am a
              skeptic, but having seen the difference some of the things we have
              learnt about have made, I feel more willing to try more things
              going forward.

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              The self reflection. I am very bad at looking inwards and
              analysing myself fairly. At times I am far too critical, and
              others I am to prideful, so finding a balance and taking note of
              both in the same space has been tough.

            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp

              Everywhere you work, you are going to be interacting with people.
              Being better prepared to approach situations with said people or
              situations that call for self improvement is invaluable.

            Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
            like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
            practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Not at all. While it is sometimes more exciting to just get on
              with the code, being given the skills to better myself and make my
              own learning easier has made the time 100% worth it.
