            What is your long term goal or career pathway?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            My goal is to find a career in Web Development or Software
            Development. I wanted to get into the programming space to begin
            with, then see what avenues there are to pursue and grow in. I came
            into this not knowing much about the space, but I started with web
            development as I feel this can have relevance to my current
            workplace and opportunities within it.

            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            Strengths:<br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Hands on learner - I grasp concepts quite quickly when I am able
                to actively practice them while I learn.
              </li>
              <li>
                Passion for knowledge - I love knowing things and how they are
                relevant to my life or others around me
              </li>
              <li>
                Curious - I ask lots of questions about how things work and push
                myself to understand them
              </li>
              <li>
                Hard-working - I push myself to the limits to complete a job or
                exercise. I do not like to leave something incomplete.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Weaknesses:<br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Easily distracted - I get side tracked quite easily if I find a
                topic or a point that I want to know more about.
              </li>
              <li>
                Communication - I struggle to communicate things succinctly. My
                thought processes are not always the most efficient which can
                lead to explanations missing the mark.
              </li>
              <li>
                Can feel smothered - I can get overwhelmed when I feel there is
                too much to do. It can lead to me being extremely unproductive
                if I do not manage it well.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overthinker - I often overthink concepts or a solution leading
                to my final solution being over-engineered.
              </li>

            What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see

          <div class="answer">
            I would love to develop my communication and time management. These
            are a couple of the most important skills to have in all aspects of
            life and I think I only stand to gain by working on them.
