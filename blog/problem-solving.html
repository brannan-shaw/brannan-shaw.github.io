              I got stuck finding the solution to the Capitalize challenge in
              the Javascript Kata.<br />
              Replacing the first letter of each word using the map method. This
              method being new to me, I got a basic understanding from looking
              it up before charging straight in to try a solution. This onbly
              made me frustrated.<br />
              I had to take a step back. Put more time in to learning about the
              method and ways in which it is applied. Being able to talk myself
              through an example helped me wrap my head around the approach I
              needed to take and which variables fit in where.<br />
              I found that frustration that is felt through the whole process
              turns into elation so quickly when the right solution is found and
              that is what kept me going.<br />
              I've learned that I need to put more research into an unknown
              factor before applying it and that breaking an issue down to its
              roots helps me understand my path to the solution a lot better.

            <p>
              I cannot think of an issue which I have elegantly solved. With the
              problems that I have been facing in these challenges, I feel that
              I have blundered my way through them a fair bit and occasionaly I
              stumble upon the correct answer on the first try.<br />
              Despite this, I learn from each problem that I face, using it to
              understand how I can better aproach any issues in the future.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Pseudocode-</strong> Pseudocode is something that I just
                need to get in the habit of doing. At this point I always forget
                about it until I have worked through and solved the issue then
                realised how useful it would have been through that process
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trying Something-</strong> I often start with just
                trying something. Sometimes to my detriment due to not fully
                understanding a concept first
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rubber Ducky Method-</strong> I think I just do this
                naturally. I talk to myself the whole time that I am trying to
                solve a problem
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reading Error Messages-</strong> I often read error
                messages but at times I feel I do not get enough detail from
                them
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Console.logging-</strong> It is not something that I am
                in the habit of doing but the few times that I have used it, it
                helped a lot
              </li>
              <li><strong>Googling-</strong> Do it none stop</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Asking your peers for help-</strong> I haven't reached a
                point yet where I feel comfortable(?) going directly to my peers
                for help. I hope for that to change as we interact more often
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Asking coaches for help-</strong> I will often do this
                as a last resort, and/or if there is something within my code
                that worked but I do not understand
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improving your process with reflection-</strong> This is
                a process that I am working on and already starting to see
                imnprovement within myself from
