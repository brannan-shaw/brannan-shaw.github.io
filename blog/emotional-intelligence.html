          <div class="prompt">What is Emotional Intelligence?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            Emotional intelligence, sometimes referred to as EQ (Emotional
            Quotient), is the skill of reading your own and other people's
            feelings and emotions and using that information to make
            decisions.<br />
            It allows someone to look internally and acknowledge an emotion
            without letting it control them.

        <div class="point">
          <div class="prompt">What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            EQ is people based. It is rooted in perceiving and understanding the
            way that a person is feeling or acting. It is honed through the
            inspection and reflection of inter/intrapersonal interactions.<br /><br />
            IQ is logic based. It is quantified by a person’s ability to
            rationalize data and solve problems.

        <div class="point">
          <div class="prompt">Why is EQ important?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            Emotional intelligence is important as it affects the way that we
            approach situations. An emotionally intelligent person is someone
            who is able to recognise an emotion within themselves or another
            person and, acknowledging that, adapt their approach to better
            facilitate the situation.<br />
            It allows people in leadership roles to manage much more effectively
            due to the ability to understand the wants of each person in their
            team and how they can be catered to.
