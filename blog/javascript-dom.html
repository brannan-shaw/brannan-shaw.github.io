            Javascript and how it works with HTML and CSS

            <p>
              A very basic way to describe the relationship between these 3
              programming languages is as if they are a football team.
            </p>
            <p>
              HTML would be the players. You need the players on the pitch to be
              able to do anything. The team could not really exist without them.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS would be what the pitch and the players look like. What
              colours are the kit? Are there any fancy designs mowed into the
              grass?
            </p>
            <p>
              Javascript would be the manager/coach. Someone who is able to
              change the instructions for a specific player or the team as
              whole. Take one player off and put another on.
            </p>
            <p>
              HTML on its own would work as a webpage but by using CSS and
              Javascript, we are able to make it look a lot nicer as well as be
              a lot more functional.

              The Document Object Model (or DOM) is a hierarchical system that
              allows for the organisation and access of aspects within a
              webpage. It is often thought of as a family tree which is
              especially apt when referring to parent and child nodes within it.
            </p>
            <img
              id="dom-tree"
              src="..\images\dom-tree.png"
              alt="layout of a DOM 'tree'"
              style="max-width: 100%; height= auto;"
            />
            <p>
              The DOM provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that a
              scripting language (in this case Javascript) uses to interact with
              the document. In that sense, the DOM kind of acts like a
              translator for the Javascript to communicate with the rest of the
              document.
            </p>
            <p>
              An obvious example of it is when we are calling an element to do
              something with, as shown below:
            </p>
            <code
              >let pageHeading = document.getElementById('pageHeading')</code
            >
            <p>
              Here we are defining a variable within Javascript. The "document"
              part is instructing the code to take the information from
              somewhere within the Document node.

        <div class="point">
          <div class="prompt">Arrays and Objects</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              An array is a range of values given in the form of an ordered
              list.<br />
              An object is made up of key-value pairs, where the key tells us
              the aspect and the value gives us the detail.
            </p>
            <p>An array would be like a team of football players</p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <code>
                let team = ['thomas', 'shane', 'david', 'jamie', 'brad'];
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              And you would access it using the index number of the player that
              you want
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <code>console.log(team[2]);</code>
            </div>
            <p>Would return "david" in the console</p>
            <p>An object would be the details for each individual program</p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <code>
                let goalkeeper = { name: 'thomas'; shirtNumber: 1; height:
                '192cm'; dominantFoot: 'left' }
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>We would acces this using the name of the object and the key</p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <code>console.log(goalkeeper.dominantFoot);</code>
            </div>
            <p>Would return "left" in the console</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="point">
          <div class="prompt">Control Flow</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Control flow is the order of operations that the code runs
              through. Javascript runs top to bottom by default. This can be
              altered by things such as conditions, loops or functions by
              telling the code to call an aspect form somewhere else in the
              script to be run at that time.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="point">
          <div class="prompt">Functions</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Functions are a set of actions that are placed within a group and
              given a name. This is useful if you need to use the same set of
              actions multiple times across a script. It saves on time as you do
              not need to type it out each time. It also means that if you ever
              need to change the way the set of actions is working, you only
              need to change it on one part of the script instead of combing
              through the whole file to change each set that was typed out.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="point">
          <div class="prompt">Loops</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Loops are something that Javascript uses to repeat a process until
              a condition is met.<br />
              We can use cleaning rooms in your house as an example.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
              <code>
                let messyRooms = ['kitchen', 'lounge', 'masterBedroom',
                'guestBedroom', 'bathroom'];<br />
                <br />
                let cleanRooms = [];<br />
                <br />
                for( i=0; i < messyRooms.length; i++){<br />
                cleanRooms.push(messyRooms[i]);<br />
                console.log(cleanRooms[i] + ' is now clean')<br />
                };
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This loop would start by 'cleaning' the first room in the array,
              then cycle through the “messyRooms” array until all of them have
              been cleaned. It would tell us in the console after each room has
              been cleaned.
            </p>
