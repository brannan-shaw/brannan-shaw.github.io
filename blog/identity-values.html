            My current job involves dealing with independent contractors and
            resolving issues that come up anywhere in their end of the pipeline.
            I feel that the attitude normally taken towards contractors can be
            quite apathetic towards the fact that they are still people. There
            have been times where we are expected to take certain approaches
            when dealing with said contractors and I adapt my own approach as I
            cannot, with a good conscience, tell these people that they should
            do something that I do not always believe that they should have to
            do.<br />
            Reflecting on it, I am glad that I have upheld my own beliefs and
            values even if it means that I may not progress within the company
            due to my approach.

            The values that I now hold dear have been imprinted on me from
            everywhere.<br />
            My parents emboldened my drive for knowledge and answers, pitting me
            against my siblings to see who could find the answer to a question
            first.<br />
            My Grandma demonstrated the need to show love and care for not just
            those close to us, but everyone that you interact with.<br />
            Moving to and living in New Zealand has taught me to work hard, but
            at the end of the day, still find joy in your surroundings.<br />
            The people I have worked alongside have made me appreciate the
            necessity of compassion and teamwork.

            I am logical, hard-working, and curious. When I am given a task, I

            The effect that this has on my learning is that I am always looking
            for how to learn and fully understand the next thing. I love to
            learn and will push myself to reach a functional understanding of
            whatever task that I am set.

            I find it hard to stay on topic/task at times. If I am researching a
            subject, I will often lead myself down a rabbit hole of certain
            aspects that I find an interest in. I also struggle with creativity
            at times. I am able to see and work on variabilities within
            situations but it is a challenge to start something from scratch.

            When I was working at the supermarket as a Duty Manager, I was often
            working the later shifts alongside mostly younger staff (students
            working after school).<br />
            A lot of the time, there was a fair amount of lost productivity due
            to chatting and an inability to multi-task. The other managers (who
            were older than I) often took a hard approach to this, separating or
            giving out less desirable tasks if they were talking too much. This
            meant that quite a few of the managers were treated almost fearfully
            or talked about behind their backs.<br />
            I had a different attitude. I knew that they would want to talk
            regardless and would end up wasting time out of sight if I assigned
            them other tasks. So I set time goals or made it a competition
            between some of them. I told them that they could work together and
            talk as much as they wanted as long as a task was completed
            efficiently. I would set them a time limit and basically bet a nicer
            task vs a less desirable one contingent on if they beat the time. I
            got comments from other supervisors and managers about how they did
            not know that some of those staff could work so well.<br />
            I still feel that this was a good strategy. I wanted people to be
            able to get even a little enjoyment whilst in the workplace where a
            lot of the time it could be quite grueling, thankless work.
